# odin-recipes

## Introduction
As part of the Foundations course on [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about), I created this simple website showcasing 3 of my favourite recipes from [allrecipes.com](https://www.allrecipes.com/) along with images of the finished dishes, ingredient lists, and step by steps directions.

## Skills
This was a very short and easy project to complete, cementing some foundational skills in HTML, by implementing some basic HTML elements such as paragraphs `<p>`, anchor tags `<a>`, images `<img>`, lists (both unordered `<ul>` and ordered `<ol>`) and more. I created a straight-forward project directory within which all the website's files are organised, and practised writing git commands in the CLI.

## Conclusion
Overall it was a fun experience and an excellent chance to practice what I've learned. Onto the next one!
