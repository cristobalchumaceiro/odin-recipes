    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup uncooked Arborio rice</li>
        <li>2 green bell peppers, halved and seeded</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tomato, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
            Lightly grease a baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Stir in rice. 
            Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until liquid is absorbed, 
            about 20 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, place peppers cut-side down on the prepared baking 
            sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until tender and skin 
            begins to brown, 25 to 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While peppers are roasting, heat oil in a medium skillet over 
            medium-high heat. Cook and stir onions, basil, Italian seasoning, 
            salt, and pepper in oil for 2 to 3 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in tomato and cook for 5 minutes. Spoon in cooked rice 
            and stir until heated through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove from heat, mix in feta cheese, and spoon mixture into 
            pepper halves.
        </li>
        <li>
            Return peppers to the oven until warmed through, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
